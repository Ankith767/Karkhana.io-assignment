Karkhana.io-assignment


## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project was to explore and apply data-driven thinking to a real-world-inspired challenge using Python. The problem domain involved creative visualizations and/or algorithmic implementation aligned with Karkhana.io's innovative and experimental culture.

## 📒 Contents

- **Notebook (`karkhana.ipynb`)**:  
  Includes code logic, step-by-step analysis, visualizations (like Möbius plots), and key insights.
  
- **Write-Up (`Karkhana io writeup.docx`)**:  
  Provides conceptual framing, problem approach, assumptions, and a summary of outcomes.

- **Image (`mobius_plot (1).png`)**:  
  A graphical output used to visualize a part of the mathematical or analytical process.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Matplotlib / NumPy** *(assumed from typical plot usage)*
- **Pandas** *(if data analysis was involved)*
